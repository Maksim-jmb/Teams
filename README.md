# Teams
updated to work on Dev 1.03 build 6778

changed some references from agent2 to get it to work on Dev 1.03 - might work on 1.02, haven't tested it tho

waiting to see what teams api will do - did mess around and put in teams with slots,layout,relaygroup changes     
* using team1,2 -rest just examples i'll put up a vid to show it    
    
revamped RR to work with mouse/modifiers in combination with addon clique....have to set each clique to global for it to work   
* couple small changes in RR made this agent much more reliable - have a hard time breaking it now     
* running thru full dungeons now without getting the "Error #132" from spamming RR to fast or switching layouts quick
     
most functions are the same as agent2, agent 5man - buttons/mouse to change layouts,RR    
cleaned up how vfx layouts start up - previous agents skipped hiding/destroying videofeeds

still messing with obs settings - little blurry yet, in the consoles-I was showing relaygroups switch with team selection
